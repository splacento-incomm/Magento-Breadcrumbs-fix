# Magento-Breadcrumbs-fix
This module fixes the issue with breadcrumbs on the product page not showing categories if the category is set to "Show in Menu = No". This problem was originally discussed [here](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30098). This solution is for Magento 2.2.4 - 2.4.6
